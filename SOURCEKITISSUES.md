# Current known SourceKit issues that prevent SwiftShield from obfuscating *everything*

# SourceKit Bugs

- [(SR-8616)](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/SR-8616) `is` pattern: Matched type won't index if the left element is an optional (`if [].first is Foo`). For now, you can overcome this by not using the optionals directly.
- [(SR-8617)](https://bugs.swift.org/browse/SR-8617) Enum names: Explicitly using an enum type in pattern matching prevents it from getting indexed (`if case MyClass.MyEnum.myCase {}` - `myCase` will be indexed, but `MyClass` won't.)
- KeyPaths like `#keyPath(Foo.bar)` don't get indexed
- Emoji Strings: Although SourceKit has no real bugs regarding emojis, it does treat them differently: While SourceKit treats emojis as several characters, Swift treats them as a single one - which will prevent SwiftShield from knowing the correct position of the references after said emoji. While a solution isn't found, you can avoid this by not using emojis.

# Types that won't be obfuscated

The following types and cases might be working correctly in SourceKit, but are currently disabled for other reasons.

- Typealiases and Associated Types: Not always indexed (`typealias Foo = UIImage | extension Foo {}` - Foo is ignored and indexed as UIImage). Note that these can't be reverse-engineered as they are purely an editor thing, so no action is required!
- Enum cases and names: Although they are correctly indexed, some enums like `CodingKeys` are not meant to be changed. This will be activated again once the way to determine if an enum is related to internal frameworks is implemented.
- Methods with names under four characters: Operators only get indexed as such if they are declared in a global scope. Since most people use `public static func`, they get indexed as regular methods. To prevent operators from being obfuscated, methods with names shorter than four characters won't get obfuscated.
- Properties: Not implemented yet!
- Module names: Not implemented yet!
