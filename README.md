# Swift/OBJ-C Obfuscator

[![GitHub release](https://img.shields.io/github/tag/rockbruno/swiftshield.svg)](https://github.com/rockbruno/swiftshield/releases)
[![GitHub license](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-lightgrey.svg)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rockbruno/swiftshield/master/LICENSE)

SwiftShield is a tool that generates irreversible, encrypted names for your iOS project's objects (including your Pods and Storyboards) in order to protect your app from tools that reverse engineer iOS apps, like class-dump and Cycript.

```swift
class fjiovh4894bvic: XbuinvcxoDHFh3fjid {
  func cxncjnx8fh83FDJSDd() {
    return vPAOSNdcbif372hFKF()
  }
}
```

## ðŸ¤– Automatic mode (Swift only)

With the `-automatic` tag, SwiftShield will use SourceKit to automatically obfuscate entire projects (including dependencies). Note that the scope of SwiftShield's automatic mode is directly related to the scope of Xcode's native refactoring tool, [which doesn't refactor everything yet](SOURCEKITISSUES.md). While the specific cases on the document won't be obfuscated, SwiftShield will obfuscate all Swift classes and methods that can be reverse-engineered.


## ðŸ›¡ Manual mode (Swift/OBJ-C)

If you feel like obfuscating absolutely everything - including typealiases and internal property names, you can also use Manual mode. This is the easiest way of running SwiftShield, but also the most time consuming. When used, SwiftShield will obfuscate properties and classes based on a tag of your choice at the end of it's name. For example, after running SwiftShield in manual mode and a tag `__s`, the following code:

```swift
class EncryptedVideoPlayer__s: DecryptionProtocol__s {
  func start__s() {
    let vc__s = ImportantDecryptingController__s(secureMode__s: true)
    vc__s.start__s(playAutomatically__s: true)
  }
}
```
becomes:
```swift
class fjiovh4894bvic: XbuinvcxoDHFh3fjid {
  func cxncjnx8fh83FDJSDd() {
    let DjivneVjxrbv42jsr = vPAOSNdcbif372hFKF(vnjdDNsbufhdks3hdDs: true)
    DjivneVjxrbv42jsr.cxncjnx8fh83FDJSDd(dncjCNCNCKSDhssuhw21w: true)
  }
}
```


## ðŸ’¥ Dealing with encrypted crash logs / analytics

After succesfully encrypting your project, SwiftShield generates a `conversionMap.txt` file with all the changes it made to your project, allowing you to pinpoint what an encrypted object really is.

## ðŸš¨ Requirements

1. No logic based on class/property names, like loading `MyClass.xib` because `String(describing: type(of:self))` is `'MyClass'`.
2. A Xcode version that has a project structure like Xcode 9.3 (which is pretty much every Xcode version for now)

Automatic mode:

1. Xcode command-line tools
2. Swift 4.1 (works on other versions, but has different results due to SourceKit)
3. No Objective-C classes that call Swift methods (Swift classes that call Objective-C methods are fine, except when interfacing is involved)
4. If you use app extensions that use a "main class" property in plists (like Rich Notifications), for now you will have to manually update their plist's main class with the obfuscated name.

Manual mode:

1. Make sure your tags aren't used on things that are not supposed to be obfuscated, like hardcoded strings.

## Installation

**Warning:** SwiftShield **irreversibly overwrites** all your source files. Ideally, you should have it run only on your CI server, and on release builds.

## Running SwiftShield

(Take a look at the Example project to see an example of what SwiftShield is capable of!)

# Automatic mode

```
swiftshield -project-root /app/MyApp -automatic-project-file /app/MyApp/MyApp.xcworkspace -automatic-project-scheme MyApp-AppStore
```
**Required Parameters:**

- `-automatic`: Enables automatic mode.

- `-project-root`: The root of your project. SwiftShield will use this to search for your project files, storyboards and source files.

- `-automatic-project-file`: Your app's main .xcodeproj/.xcworkspace file.

- `-automatic-project-scheme myScheme`: The main scheme to build from your `-automatic-project-file`.

**Optional Parameters:**

- `-ignore-modules`: Prevent certain modules from being obfuscated, separated by a comma. Use this if a certain module can't be properly obfuscated. This should be the exact name of the imported module (not the target name!). Example: `MyLib,MyAppRichNotifications,MyAppWatch_Extension`

- `-verbose`: Prints additional information.

- `-show-sourcekit-queries`: Prints queries sent to SourceKit. Note that they are huge and will absolutely clutter your terminal, so use this only for bug reports and feature development!

- `-obfuscation-character-count`: Set the number of characters that obfuscated names will have. By default, this is `32`. Be aware that using a small number will result in slower runs due to the higher possibility of name collisions.

# Manual mode

```
swiftshield -project-root /app/MyApp
```
**Required Parameters:**

- `-project-root`: The root of your project. SwiftShield will use this to search for your project files, storyboards and source files.

**Optional Parameters:**

- `-tag`: Uses a custom tag. Default is `__s`.

- `-verbose`: Prints additional information.

- `-obfuscation-character-count`: Set the number of characters that obfuscated names will have. By default, this is `32`. Be aware that using a small number will result in slower runs due to the higher possibility of name collisions.


## Automatic Mode Next Steps

- [X] Method names
- [ ] Properties
- [ ] Module names
- [ ] Update Extension plists (Rich Notifications / Watch main classes)

## Thanks

Thanks to John Holdsworth from [Refactorator](https://github.com/johnno1962/Refactorator) for `SourceKit.swift`, and to SourceKitten for helping me figure out which compile arguments to ignore for SourceKit.
